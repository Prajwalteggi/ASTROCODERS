Shiv Accounts Cloud: Orders, Invoices & Real-Time Reports

Design and implement a cloud-based accounting system for Shiv Furniture. The platform must enable seamless entry and management of core master data—Contacts, Products, Taxes, and Chart of Accounts—and support clear workflows for recording sales, purchases, and payments. The system must provide automated, real-time generation of key financial and inventory reports such as the Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss (P&L), and Stock Statement.

Functional Requirements
Master data modules for Contacts, Products, Taxes, and Chart of Accounts, each with the necessary fields for real-world use cases.

Transaction flows for handling purchase orders, vendor bills, sales orders, customer invoices, and payment registration using the established master data.

Real-time reporting with Balance Sheet, P&L, and Stock Statement generation, supporting business insight and compliance.

Role-based access for Admins, Accountants, and Contacts, ensuring appropriate data creation, modification, and restricted views.

Data validation, automatic tax calculation, and accurate ledger updates for all transactions.

Example Use Cases
Record a purchase and generate payment against a vendor.

Create a sales order, generate a customer invoice, and connect payment registration.

Generate summary financial and inventory reports at any time.

This project will simulate practical ERP and accounting workflows, challenging participants to integrate business logic, database modeling, and report automation in a modern cloud environment.
